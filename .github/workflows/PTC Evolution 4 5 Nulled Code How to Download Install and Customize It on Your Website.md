PTC Evolution is a popular script for creating and managing a paid-to-click (PTC) website. PTC websites allow users to earn money by viewing advertisements or completing tasks. However, the original script of PTC Evolution is not free and requires a license to run. Some people may try to use a nulled code, which is a modified version of the script that bypasses the license verification, to run PTC Evolution without paying for it. However, using a nulled code is illegal and risky, as it may contain malware, errors, or backdoors that can compromise your website's security and performance.
 
In this article, we will show you how to install PTC Evolution 4.5 nulled code on your website, but we do not recommend or endorse this practice. We strongly advise you to purchase a legitimate license from the official website of PTC Evolution and support the developers who created this software. If you decide to use a nulled code, you do so at your own risk and responsibility.
