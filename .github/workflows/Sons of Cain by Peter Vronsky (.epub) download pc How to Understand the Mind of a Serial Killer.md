In Sons of Cain, Peter Vronsky argues that serial killing is not a modern phenomenon, but a result of a long evolutionary process that shaped the human predator. He traces the origins of serial murder to the prehistoric era, when humans had to compete with other predators for survival and resources. He then examines how serial killing evolved in different cultures and civilizations, from ancient Rome and China to medieval Europe and colonial America. He also analyzes how the Industrial Revolution, urbanization, and mass media influenced the emergence of new types of serial killers in the 19th and 20th centuries.
 
Vronsky also provides a comprehensive overview of the psychology and criminology of serial killers, based on his extensive research and interviews with experts and offenders. He explains how serial killers are classified into different categories, such as organized or disorganized, visionary or mission-oriented, hedonistic or power/control-oriented. He also explores the factors that contribute to the development of serial killers, such as genetics, brain damage, childhood trauma, personality disorders, and social conditions. He also discusses the challenges and methods of profiling, investigating, and catching serial killers, as well as the ethical and legal issues involved in dealing with them.
