One of the most exciting features of Digital Performer 10 is Nanosampler 2.0, a major upgrade of DP's built-in sampler instrument. Nanosampler 2.0 lets you create your own custom instruments and sounds by importing any audio file and applying various editing and processing tools. You can also use Nanosampler 2.0 to create unique beats, loops, and patterns by slicing and triggering audio samples in sync with the project tempo.
 
Nanosampler 2.0 has a simple and intuitive interface that allows you to access all the essential parameters and functions with ease. You can drag and drop audio files from your computer or DP's browser into Nanosampler 2.0 and start playing them right away. You can also record audio directly into Nanosampler 2.0 using your microphone or any input device. Nanosampler 2.0 supports WAV, AIFF, MP3, FLAC, OGG, and other common audio formats.
 
Once you have imported or recorded your audio samples, you can edit them in various ways using Nanosampler 2.0's waveform display. You can trim, crop, fade, normalize, reverse, transpose, and tune your samples to suit your needs. You can also apply effects such as filters, envelopes, LFOs, pitch shifters, distortions, and more to shape the sound of your samples. You can also use Nanosampler 2.0's powerful modulation matrix to assign any parameter to any modulator for dynamic and expressive control.
