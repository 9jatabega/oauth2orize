## Tu Hi Re Marathi Movie Review: A Remake of Sillunu Oru Kaadhal
  
Tu Hi Re Marathi movie is a remake of the 2006 Tamil film Sillunu Oru Kaadhal, which starred Jyothika, Suriya and Bhumika Chawla in the lead roles. The original film was a hit at the box office and received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. The film was praised for its realistic portrayal of marital issues, emotional performances and melodious music.
  
The Marathi version of the film, directed by Sanjay Jadhav, follows the same plot and characters as the Tamil version, with some minor changes. The film features Swwapnil Joshi as Siddharth, a mechanical engineer who works in Mumbai; Sai Tamhankar as Nandini, his arranged wife who is a homemaker; and Tejaswini Pandit as Bhairavi, his college sweetheart who is now a politician's daughter.
  
The film explores the complex relationship between Siddharth and Nandini, who have different personalities and expectations from their marriage. Siddharth is still in love with Bhairavi, who left him without a word eight years ago. Nandini is a simple and traditional woman who tries to adjust to Siddharth's lifestyle and win his love. Things take a dramatic turn when Bhairavi re-enters Siddharth's life and offers him a chance to reunite with her.
  
### Tu Hi Re Marathi Movie Review: What Works and What Doesn't
  
Tu Hi Re Marathi movie has its strengths and weaknesses as a remake of a successful film. On the positive side, the film boasts of some good performances by the lead actors, especially Sai Tamhankar, who delivers a nuanced and convincing portrayal of Nandini. She brings out the emotions of a woman who is torn between her love and duty towards her husband. Swwapnil Joshi also does a decent job as Siddharth, who is conflicted between his past and present. Tejaswini Pandit looks glamorous as Bhairavi, but has a limited scope to showcase her acting skills.

The film also has some catchy songs composed by Amitraj, Pankaj Padghan and Shashank Powar. The songs "Gulabachi Kali", "Sundara" and "Tola Tola" are melodious and suit the mood of the film. The cinematography by Prasad Bhende is also impressive, capturing the scenic locations of Mumbai and Pune.
  
On the negative side, the film suffers from a lack of originality and freshness. The film follows the same story and scenes as the Tamil version, without adding any new twists or elements. The film also feels stretched and slow-paced at times, especially in the second half. The climax of the film is predictable and cliched, leaving no room for surprise or suspense.
  
The film also fails to create a strong impact on the viewers, as it does not delve deep into the characters' motivations and emotions. The film does not explore why Siddharth still loves Bhairavi after eight years of separation, or why Bhairavi left him in the first place. The film also does not show how Nandini copes with Siddharth's betrayal or how she decides to forgive him. The film relies more on melodrama than realism, making it hard for the viewers to relate to or empathize with the characters.
