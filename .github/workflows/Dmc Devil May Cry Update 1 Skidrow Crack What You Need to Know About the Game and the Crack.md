If you are new to DmC: Devil May Cry, or just want to improve your skills, here are some tips and tricks that can help you master the game and get the best Style Ranks possible.

- Learn the basics of combat. The game uses a simple but deep combat system that allows you to switch between different weapons and abilities on the fly. You can use your Rebellion sword for standard attacks, your Ebony and Ivory pistols for ranged attacks, your Angel and Demon weapons for special attacks, and your Angel and Demon pulls for mobility and crowd control. You can also use your Devil Trigger to unleash a powerful burst of damage and healing. Experiment with different combinations of weapons and abilities to find your preferred style.
- Upgrade your weapons and abilities. As you progress through the game, you will earn Red Orbs that can be used to buy items and upgrades at Divinity Statues. You can also earn upgrade points that can be used to unlock new moves and skills for your weapons and abilities. Upgrading your arsenal will make you more effective in combat and allow you to access new areas and secrets. Some of the recommended upgrades are Stinger, Drive, Enemy Step, Evade, and Overture.
- Explore the environments. The game features a variety of locations that are constantly changing and shifting due to the influence of Limbo. You can use your Angel and Demon pulls to traverse the environments and reach hidden areas. You can also find collectibles such as Lost Souls, Keys, Secret Doors, Health Crosses, and Devil Trigger Crosses that will increase your Style Rank, health, and Devil Trigger gauge. Some collectibles require specific weapons or abilities to access, so you may need to revisit some missions later.
- Challenge yourself with different difficulty levels. The game offers seven different difficulty levels that change the enemy types, damage, health, AI, and Style Rank requirements. The higher the difficulty level, the more challenging and rewarding the game becomes. You can unlock new difficulty levels by completing the previous ones or by meeting certain criteria. The difficulty levels are Human, Devil Hunter, Nephilim, Son of Sparda, Dante Must Die, Heaven or Hell, and Hell and Hell.
- Have fun! DmC: Devil May Cry is a game that encourages creativity and experimentation. You can try different weapons, combos, moves, styles, items, modes, and secrets to find what suits you best. You can also replay missions to improve your performance and Style Rank, or try the Secret Missions for extra challenges.
