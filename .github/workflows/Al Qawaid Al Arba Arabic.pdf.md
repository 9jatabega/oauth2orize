## Who is Imam Muhammad bin Abdul-Wahhab?
 
Imam Muhammad bin Abdul-Wahhab was a renowned scholar and reformer who lived in the 18th century in the Arabian Peninsula. He was born in 1115 AH (1703 CE) in Uyaynah, a town in Najd. He studied under various scholars of his time, such as his father Sheikh Abdul-Wahhab, Sheikh Abdullah bin Ibrahim Al-Najdi, Sheikh Muhammad Hayat Al-Sindi, and Sheikh Muhammad bin Sulaiman Al-Kurdi.
 
He devoted his life to calling people to the pure monotheism of Islam and warning them against shirk and innovation. He wrote many books and treatises on various topics of Islamic creed, jurisprudence, history, and biography. Some of his famous works include Kitab Al-Tawhid (The Book of Monotheism), Kashf Al-Shubuhat (The Removal of Doubts), Usul Al-Thalatha (The Three Fundamental Principles), and Al-Qawaid Al-Arba (The Four Principles).
 
He died in 1206 AH (1792 CE) in Diriyah, where he was buried. His teachings and legacy were continued by his students and followers, who became known as the Wahhabiyya or the Salafiyya.
 
## What are the Four Principles?
 
The Four Principles are four rules that Imam Muhammad bin Abdul-Wahhab derived from the Quran and the Sunnah to help Muslims understand the meaning and implications of shirk. They are as follows:
 
1. Acknowledging that Allah is the one and only Lord (i.e. Rububiyyah) is not sufficient to affirm that an individual be judged as a Muslim.
2. The polytheists whom the Prophet (peace be upon him) fought against acknowledged that Allah is the Creator, Provider, and Sustainer of everything, yet they still committed shirk by worshipping others besides Him.
3. They say: âWe donât worship them except to bring us closer to Allah.â This is the same excuse that the polytheists of old used to justify their shirk.
4. The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not differentiate between those who worshipped idols, angels, prophets, righteous people, or other created beings. He called them all to worship Allah alone without any partners.

These four principles are based on clear evidences from the Quran and the Sunnah, such as Surah Al-Kafirun, Surah Yunus verse 18, Surah Az-Zumar verse 3, Surah An-Nisa verse 48, Surah Al-Maeda verse 72, Surah Maryam verse 81-82, Surah An-Nahl verse 20-21, Surah Al-Anbiya verse 66-67, Surah Al-Hajj verse 73-74, Surah An-Najm verse 23-24, Surah Al-Furqan verse 55-56, Surah Al-Anam verse 22-24, Surah At-Taubah verse 31-32, Surah Luqman verse 13-15, Surah Ibrahim verse 35-36, Surah Ibrahim verse 22-23.
