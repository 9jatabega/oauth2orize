One of the strengths of the book is that it covers both the normative and the descriptive aspects of grammar. It explains the standard rules of grammar that are accepted by the academic community and the society, but it also acknowledges the diversity and variation of language use in different contexts and situations. It does not judge or prescribe how people should speak or write, but rather describes and analyzes how they do so.
 
Another strength of the book is that it connects grammar with communication and text production. It does not treat grammar as an isolated or abstract system, but rather as a tool for expressing meaning and creating texts. It shows how grammar choices can affect the clarity, coherence, cohesion, and style of a text. It also offers guidance and strategies for writing different types of texts, such as narratives, descriptions, arguments, reports, letters, etc.
 
However, the book also has some limitations and weaknesses. One of them is that it does not include enough exercises or activities to practice and apply the grammar concepts. The exercises are mostly multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank questions, which do not require much creativity or critical thinking. The book could benefit from more open-ended or interactive exercises that challenge the reader to use grammar in authentic and meaningful contexts.
 
Another limitation of the book is that it does not reflect the recent changes or developments in grammar research or teaching. The book was published before the implementation of the new orthographic agreement of 2009, which modified some of the spelling rules of Portuguese. The book also does not incorporate the contributions of linguistic theories or approaches that have emerged or gained popularity in recent years, such as functional grammar, cognitive grammar, discourse analysis, genre analysis, etc.
