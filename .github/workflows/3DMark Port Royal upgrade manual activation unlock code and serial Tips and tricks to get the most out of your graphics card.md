## Troubleshooting
 
If you encounter any problems with upgrading or activating 3DMark Port Royal on Steam, here are some possible solutions:

- If you have a standalone 3DMark Advanced license that starts with 3DM-ICFTPS-, 3DM-SPD-, or 3DM-STO-, you cannot add it to your Steam account due to a Steam policy change[^1^]. However, you can still use any 3DMark Steam license on the standalone version of 3DMark. You can see your 3DMark standalone licenses in the Steam version by going to "Options".
- If you have a 3DMark Advanced Edition license that starts with 3DM-ICF-, you can add it to Steam by opening the Steam client, clicking the "+ADD A GAME" button at the bottom of the window, then "ACTIVATE A PRODUCT ON STEAM," and then following the instructions[^1^].
- If you have a Time Spy upgrade license that starts with 3DM-SPY-, you can follow the same steps as for a Port Royal upgrade license that starts with 3DM-PR-, but use the box under ADD 3DM 8cf37b1e13
