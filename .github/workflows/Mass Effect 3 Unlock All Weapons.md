Mass Effect 3 is a sci-fi action RPG that lets you customize your character and your weapons to suit your playstyle. There are over 30 different weapons in the game, each with its own stats, mods, and upgrades. However, not all of them are easy to find or obtain. Some of them are hidden in specific missions, some of them are only available in shops, and some of them require a new game plus to reach the maximum level. In this article, we will show you how to unlock all weapons in Mass Effect 3, including the ones from DLCs and pre-order bonuses.
 
## Weapon Categories
 
There are six categories of weapons in Mass Effect 3: assault rifles, heavy pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, submachine guns, and heavy weapons. Each category has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the range, accuracy, damage, rate of fire, ammo capacity, and weight of the weapon. You can equip up to two weapons at a time, but the more weight you carry, the longer your power cooldowns will be. Therefore, you should choose your weapons wisely according to your class and your squadmates.

## Weapon Locations
 
Most of the weapons in Mass Effect 3 can be found during missions, either lying around or dropped by enemies. However, some of them are easy to miss if you don't explore every corner or loot every corpse. If you miss a weapon during a mission, you may have another chance to get it from a shop later on, but not all of them are available that way. Therefore, it is recommended to follow a guide or a walkthrough to make sure you don't miss any weapon in the game.
