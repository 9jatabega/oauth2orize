The 2008 series featured Justin Bruening as Mike Traceur, the estranged son of Michael Knight, who inherits a new version of KITT (Knight Industries Three Thousand), voiced by Val Kilmer. Mike works for the Knight Foundation, a government-funded organization that uses advanced technology to fight crime and terrorism. The series also starred Deanna Russo as Sarah Graiman, Mike's childhood friend and daughter of KITT's creator; Bruce Davison as Charles Graiman, Sarah's father and Mike's mentor; Sydney Tamiia Poitier as Carrie Rivai, an FBI agent who assists the Knight Foundation; and Paul Campbell as Billy Morgan, a technical expert and comic relief.
 
The series began with a two-hour pilot movie that aired on February 17, 2008.

The pilot movie was well received by fans and critics, and was watched by 12.7 million viewers.

Knight Rider 2008 was an attempt to revive the iconic franchise for a new generation of viewers, but it faced several challenges and criticisms. The series suffered from low ratings, mixed reviews, creative differences, budget cuts, and a writers' strike that affected its production. The series was canceled after one season of 17 episodes, ending with a cliffhanger that left many questions unanswered.
 
Despite its short-lived run, Knight Rider 2008 has gained a cult following among fans of the original series and new viewers alike. The series has been praised for its action sequences, special effects, humor, and chemistry between the cast members. The series has also been criticized for its inconsistent tone, lack of character development, plot holes, and deviation from the original concept.

Knight Rider 2008 was created by Dave Andron, who also served as the executive producer and showrunner. Andron was a fan of the original series and wanted to pay homage to it while also updating it for a modern audience. He envisioned the series as a "Transformers meets The Bourne Identity" hybrid, with KITT having more advanced abilities and a sleeker design. Andron also wanted to explore the themes of identity, family, and destiny that were present in the original series.
 
The series featured several references and connections to the original series, such as using the same theme song, having KITT's scanner be red, and having Michael Knight appear as Mike's father. The series also introduced new elements and characters, such as KITT's ability to transform into different vehicles, Mike's mysterious past as a former soldier and spy, and the existence of KARR (Knight Automated Roving Robot), KITT's evil prototype. The series also had guest stars from other popular shows and movies, such as Smith Cho from The Office, Rick Hoffman from Suits, and Yancey Arias from Bosch.
 
Knight Rider 2008 was filmed in various locations in California, Nevada, and Hawaii. The series used a mix of practical and CGI effects to create the action scenes and KITT's transformations. The series also used real cars for KITT's different modes, such as a Ford Mustang GT500KR for his normal mode, a Ford F-150 FX4 for his off-road mode, and a Ford E-150 for his cargo mode. The series also featured other Ford vehicles as part of a product placement deal with the company.
