## Who is Spartacus?
 
Spartacus was a Thracian warrior who was enslaved by the Romans and forced to fight as a gladiator in the arena. He was trained in the ludus (gladiator school) of Batiatus, a ruthless lanista (gladiator owner) who exploited his slaves for profit and fame. Spartacus soon became a champion gladiator, earning the respect and admiration of his fellow slaves and the audience.
 
However, Spartacus was not content with his life as a slave. He longed for freedom and justice, and he also fell in love with a fellow slave named Sura, who was sold to another owner. Spartacus decided to escape from the ludus, along with his friend Varro and other gladiators. He also managed to rescue Sura from her captors, but she was mortally wounded by an assassin sent by Batiatus. Spartacus swore vengeance against Batiatus and the Roman Republic, and he rallied other slaves to join his cause.
