## What is KMSpico?
 
KMSpico is a tool that uses an unofficial key management services (KMS) server to activate Windows and Office products without a license[^7^]. KMS is a legitimate technology used by Microsoft to activate software in bulk for large organizations with volume licensed products[^8^]. KMSpico exploits this technology by changing your retail version of Windows or Office to a volume licensed one, and then connecting to a fake KMS server set up by the hack tool's developer[^8^]. This way, KMSpico can trick your system into thinking that it is activated by Microsoft.
