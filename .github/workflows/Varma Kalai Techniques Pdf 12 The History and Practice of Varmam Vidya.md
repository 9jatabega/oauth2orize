Varma Kalai techniques are classified into four types:
 
- Thodu Varmam: 96 vital points triggered by a touch. Not deadly, but will affect the victim by disabling the body, organ movements and function.
- Padu Varmam: 12 vital points that are fatal, causing immediate, severe effects upon the victim.
- Thattu Varmam: 108 vital points triggered by sound, light, or gesture. These are secret techniques that require advanced training and knowledge.
- Nooku Varmam: The highest level of Varma Kalai, where the practitioner can subdue or kill an opponent with a mere glance or thought. This is considered a mythical or supernatural skill that few can master.

Varma Kalai is not only a martial art, but also a healing system that uses the same vital points to cure various diseases and ailments. Varma Kalai practitioners are trained in anatomy, physiology, and medicine, as well as in spiritual and ethical aspects of the art.

## Varma Kalai: The Ancient History and Origins
 
Varma Kalai has a long and rich history that dates back to ancient times. According to folklore, Varma Kalai was taught by the god Shiva to his son Murugan, who then passed it on to the sage Agastya[^1^]. Agastya was the first to record and disseminate the knowledge of 108 Varmams (vital points) among his students. He also composed Sanskrit verses that explained the art of Varma Kalai. However, these original verses are not available now, and only some poetic verses by later siddhas (enlightened masters) remain as sources of learning Varma Kalai.

Varma Kalai was traditionally practiced by Nadars and Devars, two communities in Tamil Nadu and Kerala[^2^] [^4^]. During the early days of the Pandya and Chola dynasties, Varma Kalai was used as a form of experimentation on slaves and captured warriors, to discover the weaknesses in the human body[^4^]. Thousands of warriors gave up their lives to develop this martial art. Varma Kalai was also used as a form of self-defense and combat by unarmed warriors, who followed a code of honor and ethics. They preferred to fight against armed opponents with their bare hands, using their knowledge of vital points to subdue or kill them.
 
Varma Kalai was not only a martial art, but also a spiritual and medical system. The practitioners of Varma Kalai were trained in yoga, meditation, philosophy, ethics, and medicine. They used their skills to heal various diseases and ailments by manipulating the vital points. They also used sound, light, gesture, and thought to influence the vital points of themselves or others. Some of them even claimed to have attained supernatural powers such as levitation, invisibility, telepathy, and mind control through Varma Kalai.
 
Varma Kalai is a rare and endangered art that is facing extinction due to various factors such as lack of patronage, secrecy, modernization, and social stigma. Only a few genuine masters and practitioners remain today, who are trying to preserve and propagate this ancient art for future generations.
