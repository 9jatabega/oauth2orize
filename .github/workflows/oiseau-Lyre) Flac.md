If you are a fan of early music, you may want to listen to these recordings in FLAC format. FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, and it is a file format that compresses audio data without losing any information. This means that you can enjoy the full sound quality of the original recording, without any distortion or noise. FLAC files are also smaller than uncompressed WAV files, so they take up less space on your device.

## The history of L'Oiseau-Lyre
 
L'Oiseau-Lyre was founded by Louise Hanson-Dyer, an Australian-born musicologist and patron of the arts, who moved to France in 1930. She was passionate about early music and wanted to publish scholarly editions of works that had never been previously published. She named the company after the lyrebird, a bird native to Australia that can mimic various sounds, including musical instruments.
 
The first project of L'Oiseau-Lyre was a 12-volume collection of the complete works of FranÃ§ois Couperin, published in 1933 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of his death. This was followed by other editions of composers such as Rameau, Lully, Monteverdi, Purcell, and Bach. The editions were praised for their high quality of printing and scholarship, and Hanson-Dyer was awarded the LÃ©gion d'Honneur in 1934 for her contribution to French culture.
 
After World War II, Hanson-Dyer moved the company to Monaco and started to produce recordings of early music. She hired Christopher Hogwood as the artistic director and invited many renowned performers to record for the label. Some of the most famous recordings include Handel's Messiah, Mozart's Piano Concertos, Rameau's Overtures, and Bach's Brandenburg Concertos.
 
Hanson-Dyer died in 1962 and her husband Jeff Hanson continued to run the company until his death in 1963. His second wife Margarita Hanson took over the management and oversaw the publication of several series of music editions, such as Polyphonic Music of the Fourteenth Century, Magnus Liber Organi, and Le Grand Clavier. She also collaborated with the University of Melbourne, where she donated her collection of manuscripts and printed music.
 
In 1996, Margarita Hanson retired and Davitt Moroney became the president of L'Oiseau-Lyre. He continued to publish new editions and reissues of early music until 2001, when he left the company. Kenneth Gilbert succeeded him as the president and brought the Magnus Liber Organi series to completion. He also published new editions of Louis Couperin's Organ works and revised reprints of earlier L'Oiseau-Lyre editions.
 
In 2013, L'Oiseau-Lyre ended its presence in Europe and reverted to its parent holding, Lyrebird Press, at the University of Melbourne. The record label became a part of Decca Records and released three box sets of 50 discs each of L'Oiseau-Lyre recordings: The Baroque Era (2015), Classical & Early Romantic (2016), and Medieval & Renaissance (2017).
