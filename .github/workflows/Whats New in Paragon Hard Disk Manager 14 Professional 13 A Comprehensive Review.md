If you are looking for a reliable and versatile tool to manage your hard disks and data, you should consider Paragon Hard Disk Manager 14 Professional 13. This software is an all-in-one solution that offers a range of features and benefits for Windows users, such as:
 
- **Backup and recovery:** You can easily create backups of your system, disks, partitions, files and folders, and restore them in case of any disaster. You can also use the Paragon Recovery Media Builder to fix boot problems and recover your system from isolated containers. The software supports Windows BitLocker encryption, allowing you to protect your data from unauthorized access and recover it faster than the native Windows feature. Moreover, the software uses the new pVHD (Paragon Virtual Hard Drive) format for storing backups, which is optimized for incremental imaging, data deduplication and synchronization. With pVHD, your backups can be up to four times smaller than the original data and ten times faster to create and restore.
- **Drive copy and migration:** You can easily transfer your data to a new hard disk or SSD, or migrate your system to a virtual environment. The software allows you to resize partitions, exclude some data from the transfer, and copy or restore data from different sector sizes. You can also clone your entire hard disk or individual partitions without rebooting.
- **Partition manager:** You can create, format, delete, merge, split, resize, move and convert partitions without losing data. You can also optimize your disk performance by aligning partitions, defragmenting them, checking their integrity and fixing errors. The software supports dynamic disks and storage spaces, as well as uEFI configurations.
- **Disk wiper:** You can securely erase your data from any storage device, including SSDs. You can choose from various wiping algorithms that meet different security standards. You can also wipe only free space or unused sectors without affecting existing data.

Paragon Hard Disk Manager 14 Professional 13 is compatible with Windows 8.1 and its Metro-style interface. It also works with Windows 7, Vista and XP. It supports all kinds of storage devices, including internal and external hard disks, SSDs, USB flash drives, memory cards and more.
