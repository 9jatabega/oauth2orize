# OAuth2orize

OAuth2orize is an authorization server toolkit for Node.js.  It provides a suite
of middleware that, combined with [Passport](http://passportjs.org/)
authentication middleware and application-specific route handlers, can be used
to assemble a server that implements the [OAuth 2.0](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-28)
protocol.
